# QUETION AND ANSWER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Why is list used?

Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java).
Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python. 
A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects. Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.
List in Python are ordered and have a definite count.
The elements in a lit are indexed according to a definite sequence and the indexing of a list is done with 0 being the first index.
Each element in the list has its definite place in the list, which allows duplicating of elements in the list, with each element having its own distinct place and credibility.

b. How do lists and sets differ?

# List: 
Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python. The main characteristics of lists are – 

* The list is a datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
* List are mutable .i.e it can be converted into another data type and can store any data element in it.
* List can store any type of element.

# Set: 
In Python, Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. The main characteristics of set are –

* Sets are an unordered collection of elements or unintended collection of items In python.
* Here the order in which the elements are added into the set is not fixed, it can change frequently.
* It is defined under curly braces{}
* Sets are mutable, however, only immutable objects can be stored in it.

c. Application of dictionaries with a real world example

As a dictionary, keeps the elements in key-value mapping format and internally uses hashing for it;therefore, we can get a value from the dictionary by its key very quickly.
In best cases, its complexity is O(1), whereas, in the worst case, its complexity can be O(n).

Application of dictionary : dictionaries are used in maintaining 
* phone numbers with name as keys
* username and password
